# 🔧 FIX MIGRATION MISMATCH - FINAL SOLUTION

Services are running! The migration records need a complete cleanup.

## ✅ FINAL FIX (Copy & Paste)

All three migrations (20260214000000, 20260214000001, 20260214000002) were modified after being recorded.

**Delete all three at once**:
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U sokoul -d sokoul -c "DELETE FROM _sqlx_migrations WHERE version >= 20260214000000;"
```

Then run:
```bash
cargo run
```

---

## Why This Works

The migration files were changed after being initially recorded in the database. By deleting the records, sqlx will re-execute them fresh with the current (correct) file content.
